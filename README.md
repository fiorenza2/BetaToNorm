# BetaToNorm

A simple function that helps to fit beta and normal curves

I used this to find the beta approximation to a normal distribution, as a beta nicely bottoms out between 0 and 1. This meant that I could define an explicit range, as opposed to the potentially infinite range of the normal RV.
